**`Software_Developer  and Technical_Writer.`**


I am Progress Ochuko Eyaadah, better known as Koxy in the software development realm. With a deep-rooted passion for crafting software solutions, I've journeyed through the tech landscape as a dedicated developer.

JavaScript & Typescript are my canvas of choice, where I've harnessed its power to breathe life into numerous projects. Beyond coding, I wear the hat of a technical writer, driven by the desire to document knowledge and empower fellow tech enthusiasts.

Outside the lines of code, I'm an avid follower of technology trends, always eager to absorb the latest advancements. With a history of excellence in development, a passion for knowledge sharing, and a deep appreciation for teamwork, I am resolute in my mission to shape the ever-evolving tech landscape.
