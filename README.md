# 👩‍🍳 Dev Koxy

**`Software_Developer  and Technical_Writer.`**


I am Progress Ochuko Eyaadah, better known as Koxy in the software development realm. With a deep-rooted passion for crafting software solutions, I've journeyed through the tech landscape as a dedicated developer.

JavaScript & Typescript are my canvas of choice, where I've harnessed its power to breathe life into numerous projects. Beyond coding, I wear the hat of a technical writer, driven by the desire to document knowledge and empower fellow tech enthusiasts.

My adventurous spirit leads me to explore new protocols and technologies continually. This curiosity has propelled me to participate in multiple hackathons, where I've proudly clinched victory four times, working collaboratively with exceptional teams. These successes underscore not only my problem-solving prowess but also my commitment to effective teamwork, which has been a cornerstone of our achievements.

Outside the lines of code, I'm an avid follower of technology trends, always eager to absorb the latest advancements. With a history of excellence in development, a passion for knowledge sharing, and a deep appreciation for teamwork, I am resolute in my mission to shape the ever-evolving tech landscape.
